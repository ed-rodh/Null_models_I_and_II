# Null_models_I_and_II

 Simulating annealing based strategies to randomize sequences data, there is two strategies:
 
  + Null model I: ramdomizes the input MSA by conserving the single columns statistics.
 
  + Null model II: randomizes the input MSA preserving both single columns statistics and pairwise hamming distances between sequences.
   
 A complete description of the algorithm can be found at (Edwin Rodriguez Horta, Weigt M.,Phylogenetic correlations have limited effect on coevolution-based contact prediction in proteins).

# Install
To install the package under version >= 1.0 use the package manager 

(v1.?) pkg> add https://github.com/ed-rodh/Null_models_I_and_II

# Overview


# Usage
Load the julia package by

 ```julia
 julia> using Null_models_I_and_II
 ```
This software provide two main functions ```sample_from_Null_model_I(infile::String;outfile="",Temp=10.0)``` and ```sample_from_Null_model_II(infile::String;outfile="",schuffle=1,Temp=10.0)``` which are in charge of generating new sequence data according to null models I and II respectively. Function ```julia sample_from_Null_model_I()``` is faster. 

 + Both functions take as input a file with protein's multiple sequence alignments  in fasta format. 
 + Optional parameter   "outfile"    name text file for the output alignment exported in fasta format.
 + Parameter "Temp" stands for the  temperature in Monte Carlo sampling to shuffling the sequences data (is recommended to set Temp>1).
 + Parameter 'schuffle' allows or not to initialize the sampling strategy of the null modell II from sequences data generated by null model I (is recommended schuffle=1). 


# Output

The functions output a type Array{Char,2} wich describe a matrix of aminoacids letters, then if outfile is not empty then the output alignment is exported as a text file in fasta format.

=> For a quick test we recommend the alignment included in Null_models_I_and_II/
# Requirements

The code now requires at least Julia version 1.0 or later.
