# Null_models_I_and_II

 Simulating annealing based strategies to randomize sequences data composed by:
 
  + Null model I: ramdomizes the input MSA by conserving the single columns statistics.
 
  + Null model II: randomizes the input MSA preserving both single columns statistics and pairwise hamming distances between sequences.
   
 A complete description of the algorithm can be found at (Edwin Rodriguez Horta, Weigt M.,Phylogenetic correlations have limited effect on coevolution-based contact prediction in proteins).

The code now requires at least Julia version 1.0 or later.
